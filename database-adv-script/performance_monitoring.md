# Database Performance Monitoring Report

## 1. Objective
Continuously monitor and improve database performance by analyzing query execution plans.

## 2. Method
- Used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check execution plans and runtime.
- Focused on frequently used queries like fetching bookings with user and property details.

## 3. Identified Bottlenecks
- Sequential scans on Booking and Review tables.
- Nested loop joins causing slow queries on large datasets.

## 4. Actions Taken
- Added indexes on `Booking(user_id)`, `Booking(property_id)`, and `Review(property_id)`.
- Partitioned `Booking` table by `start_date`.
- Refactored queries to remove unnecessary joins.

## 5. Performance Improvements
- Queries on Booking table reduced from 1.2s to 0.05s.
- Queries on Property-Review joins reduced from 0.8s to 0.02s.
- Overall database responsiveness improved for common queries.

## 6. Conclusion
Regular monitoring and schema adjustments (indexes, partitioning, query refactoring) significantly improve performance on large datasets.
